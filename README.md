# Little Lemon Booking Website

## Description

This is a website built using React during the Meta Front-End Development Online course.

The project consisted of many steps, including wireframing, building a style guide, prototyping, and then building the app in React.

The pages that were included for this project include the home page and the reservations page. The reservations page features a controlled form which allows you to select a date, time, number of guests, and occasion for your reservation. The form also includes client-side validation with concise and clear error messages.

The page was designed for 1440p screens, and I intend to add responsiveness for smaller sized screens as well.
